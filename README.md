## Setting up

For installing with libraries' requirement on **Vercel** use the next in the install command: `yum install automake -y && yarn install`.

As we are not using optimization libraries, we don't need use this method anymore.

## Notes

- For lazy-loaded images, for now we can't not do this easily with the [**next/image**](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/20127) component.
